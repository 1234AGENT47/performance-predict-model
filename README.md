Introduction

The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has transformed various sectors, with education being a primary beneficiary. In today’s data-driven academic landscape, educational institutions are increasingly adopting digital strategies to enhance teaching, learning, and administrative processes. One of the most promising applications of AI in education is the prediction of student performance, which enables educators to identify at-risk students early and implement timely interventions to improve learning outcomes . Traditional methods of monitoring student progress such as periodic exams and quizzes often fall short in providing actionable, real-time insights, thereby limiting educators’ ability to support struggling students before academic issues become critical.

AI-based student performance prediction models leverage a wide array of data, including demographic information, academic records, behavioral patterns, and digital engagement metrics, to forecast academic outcomes [1][5][6]. These models utilize sophisticated algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks, and XGBoost to analyze complex relationships between student attributes and academic success . By processing large datasets, these models can uncover patterns that are not readily apparent through traditional analysis, enabling more accurate and nuanced predictions of student achievement and risk of failure .

The implementation of AI-driven prediction tools offers several advantages. First, it empowers educators to proactively identify students likely to underperform, allowing for the allocation of resources and support where they are needed most. Second, it provides a scalable and flexible solution that can be adapted to various educational contexts and courses, enhancing institutional accountability and educational quality . Third, these systems can inform personalized learning strategies, ensuring that interventions are tailored to the unique needs of each student .

Despite these benefits, challenges remain. Accurately predicting high achievers and distinguishing between different levels of academic success require more nuanced modeling approaches and richer datasets [4]. Factors such as motivation, study habits, and the quality of engagement are often difficult to quantify but play a significant role in academic outcomes. Additionally, ethical considerations regarding data privacy and algorithmic bias must be addressed to ensure fair and responsible use of AI in education.
This project aims to develop an AI-based student performance prediction model that harnesses the power of machine learning to provide actionable insights for educators and administrators. By integrating diverse data sources and advanced analytical techniques, the model aspires to enhance early intervention strategies, promote student success, and contribute to a more equitable educational environment .
